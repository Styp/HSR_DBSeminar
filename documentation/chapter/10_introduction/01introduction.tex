\chapter{Introduction}

This paper is the result of the seminar on "Advanced Database Systems" at the University of Applied Science Rapperswil. The paper shall cover all the necessary concepts of "Streaming Database Systems" and investigating one particular product for its abilities. The product is determined to be "Apache Spark Streaming" which is well known to be used in companies handling big data flows for daily business like Uber\cite{uber}, Netflix and Pinterest.

\section{Motivation}
Modern \Gls{RDBMS} show the perfect snapshot of the past, while modern businesses rely heavily on data, these concepts become limiting. While there is a need for storage and persistence, where \Gls{RDBMS}s are still in their prime, there is another need for real time data processing. Real time data processing can be useful to give an accurate anticipation about the future. This use case is a driving force to justify an new database concept for data streams - the \Gls{DSMS} is born.
